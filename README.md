# COVESA VISS Reference Implementation - VISSR 
This project provides a reference implementation of the released [COVESA VISSv2.0 specification](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification/releases/tag/v2.0) on the v2.0 branch,
and an ongoing development of a reference implementation of the [VISSv3.0 specification](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification) on the master branch.

# Tutorial
A tutorial can be found <a href="https://covesa.github.io/vissr/">here</a>.

## VISSv3.0 new features
* Multiple tree support. The server can be configured to manage multiple trees that a client can access.
* Server capabilities. A Server tree can be accessed by clients.
* File transfer. Upload/download of files is available on Websocket.
* Data compression. Request local path compression and Request relative timestamp compression is available on Websocket.
* Protobuf encoding is available on Websocket.
* gRPC support. This wa already available on an experimental level in VISSR @v2.0.
* JSON scheme used to validate client requests.
* Support for the VSS struct datatype.
* Error responses due to JSON scheme errors contain a description generated by the JSON scheme validator.

### Non-backwards compatible changes from VISSv2.0
* The filter keyname "type" is changed to "variant".
* The filter variants "static-metadata" and "dynamic-metadata" are replaced by the variant "metadata".
* The "subscriptionId" parameter in unsubscribe response messages is deleted.
* The error object keyword "message" is changed to "description".
* The error:decription values are not normative any more.

## VISSv2.0 features
* HTTP/Websocket/MQTT(incl app-level protocol on top).
* Get/Set/Subscribe/Unsubscribe methods (Subscribe/Unsubscribe not available over HTTP).
* Filters supported are Timebased/Change/Range/Curvelog/Paths/Metadata (History currently inactivated).
* Access control including RBAC support and policy document usage as per specification.
* Consent support. The server may connect to an External Consent Framework and together realize consent functionality.

### Non-spec features
* HTTP, Websocket, and gRPC can be configured to run with/without TLS.
* gRCP is supported also by the v2.0 server implementation.
* SwCs such as feeder and datastore are available to realize a complete tech stack from client to the vehicle "native" domain.
* Tool for realizing a data mapping between the "VSS domain" and the vehicle "native" domain (e.g. between VSS and CAN data).
