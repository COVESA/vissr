## SQLite state storage
When an SQLite database is used as the state storage it is necessary to prepopulate it with one row for each VSS treeleaf node, having the path name as the key.
To do this there is a [statestorage_mgr](https://github.com/COVESA/ccs-components/tree/master/statestorage/sqlImpl) that takes a file containing a list of all the pathnames,
"vsspathlist.json" as input. This file is generated by the server at startup, taking the paths from the VSS tree that it has access to.

This SQLite DB file then needs to be moved to the WAII/server/visv2server/serviceMgr directory, where it should have the name "statestorage.db"
(if server configuration is not changed to another name).
