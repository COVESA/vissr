## COVESA Vehicle Information Service Specification ver 3 Reference Implementation Tutorial

The COVESA VISSv3 specification is under development at the [COVESA VISS Github](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle-information-service-specification).
A VISSv3.0 reference implementation in the form of a server that exposes an interface according to the specification is developed on the master branch,
while a VISSv2.0 reference implementation is available on the v2.0 branch.

This documentation covers the VISSv3.0 specification.
The new features are listed below.
It is with a few exceptions backwards compatible with VISSv2.0. The exceptions are listed below.

### VISSv3.0 new features
* Multiple tree support. The server can be configured to manage multiple trees that a client can access.
* Server capabilities. A Server tree can be accessed by clients.
* File transfer. Upload/download of files is available on Websocket.
* Data compression. Request local path compression and Request relative timestamp compression is available on Websocket.
* Protobuf encoding is available on Websocket.
* gRPC support. This wa already available on an experimental level in VISSR @v2.0.
* JSON scheme used to validate client requests.
* Error responses due to JSON scheme errors contain a description generated by the JSON scheme validator.

### Non-backwards compatible changes from VISSv2.0
* The filter keyname "type" is changed to "variant".
* The filter variants "static-metadata" and "dynamic-metadata" are replaced by the variant "metadata".
* The "subscriptionId" parameter in unsubscribe response messages is deleted.
* The error object keyword "message" is changed to "description".
* The error:decription values are not normative any more.

Also found on this repo are implementations of other components that are needed to realize a communication tech stack that reaches from clients through the server and to the underlying vehicle system interface.

These software components (SwCs) can be categorized as follows:
* server
* clients
* data storage
* feeders
* tools

The tutorial describes each SwC category in a separate chapter.
It also contains a few Proof of concept (POC) examples, and information about installing,
building and running Golang based SwCs, a Docker containerization, and about some peripheral components.
